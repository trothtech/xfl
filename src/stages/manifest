# Stages

This is the stages source code directory for POSIX Pipelines

## Manifest

    manifest            this file (see counterpart one level up)
    configure           configurator script
    makefile.in         skeleton makefile
    makefile            generated
    configure.h         generated
    configure.sh        generated
